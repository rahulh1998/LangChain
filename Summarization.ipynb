       "'Chelsea Football Club, founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher\\'s Hook) in London, plays in the Premier League, the top tier of English football.  Several names were considered for the new club, including Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC, before settling on \"Chelsea\" after the adjacent borough to avoid confusion with the existing Fulham team. Their home ground is Stamford Bridge, which was originally an athletics stadium acquired by Gus Mears in 1904.  Mears initially planned to lease the stadium to Fulham F.C., but that proposal was turned down.  The club was elected to the Football League shortly after its founding.  \\n\\nIn their early years, Chelsea gained promotion to the First Division in their second season but quickly yo-yoed between the top two tiers.  They were known for signing star players, which contributed to their early success and attracted large crowds, even having the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons. They reached the 1915 FA Cup final, though they were ultimately defeated by Sheffield United.  The club also had a strong season in 1920, finishing third in the First Division, their best league performance to date. They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success **eluded the club in the inter-war years.**\\n\\nA turning point came in 1952 with the appointment of Ted Drake, former Arsenal and England centre-forward, who modernized the club. This ultimately led to their first major domestic trophy, the First Division championship, in 1955.  They continued to find success,  winning their first Premier League title in the 2004–05 season.  The club has won six top-flight league titles, along with eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields, making them the fifth-most successful club in English football.  \\n\\nAt international level, Chelsea won their first European trophy in 1971, lifting the Cup Winners\\' Cup, which they won again in 1998. They went on to win their first UEFA Champions League title in 2012 and repeated the feat in 2021. Chelsea have won the UEFA Europa League twice, in 2013 and 2019. After winning the UEFA Conference League in 2025, becoming the first club to win all four main UEFA competitions, as well as all UEFA Men\\'s competitions. They also won the FIFA Club World Cup in 2021 and 2025, the latter being the contest\\'s first iteration with 32 teams.  Chelsea have notable rivalries with fellow London teams Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Fulham, and also with Leeds United.  \\n\\nSince 2022, the club has been owned by BlueCo. \\n\\n\\n\\n'"
